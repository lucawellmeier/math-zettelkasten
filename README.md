# math-zettelkasten

This is a digital implementation of a 
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), i.e. a 
knowledge database 
(prominently used, for example, by Niklas Luhmann), 
specifically tailored to my needs as a mathematics student.

**Features and roadmap:**
 - [ ] simple (Markdown + Tex)-based file format with rapid preview
 - [ ] powerful cross-referencing and dependency control inside the Zettelkasten
 - [ ] simple bibliography management
 - [ ] archiving in a database using ids and tags
 - [ ] (partial) output as templated webpage or LaTeX document using [pandoc]()
